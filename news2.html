                <p>Following their massively successful collaboration with Disclosure on “White Noise,” AlunaGeorge’s “Attracting Flies” is the latest single from an upcoming album. Although less overtly “electronic” than the typical track I review, it’s worth looking into the sharp, dusted production that makes this tune have serious pop appeal without compromising its seriously spunky personality.<br /><br />

(0:00)
Dusty guitar stabs, claps, and a wonky synth riff start us off, quickly hooking the listener in. Repeat this section a few times — try to pick out the fuzzy, warm (dusty) distortion on each element and the short reverb that adds space to the synth. Notice how dirty and punchy the clap/snare layered drum sounds — the technical term for this is crunchy, really. Just when your ear has had time to hear and (subconsciously) understand every component of the beat (which takes about four measures in this case), the track jumps into the vocal verse. Such quick starts and short sections like these are essential in pop-esque music in order to quickly grab a first-time, casual listener’s capricious attention. The producer can’t afford to waste any time in the song’s structure because the difference between the song’s success and failure is often determined by how many people flip to the next video or radio station after just 10 seconds of listening.<br /><br />

Aluna’s vocal works wonderfully against the rhythm of the drums, and little bubbly synth arpeggios at the end of each measure nicely complement the vocal’s melody. Notice how a few sounds are removed from the drums at the end of the verse (0:25) — this is for the sake of variation and also for leaving some breathing room so that the following section sounds a little bigger. These subtle variations are crucial for smoothing over transitions, raising or lowering energy appropriately.<br /><br />

(0:38)
After a short pre-chorus, the chorus comes in with “little grey fairy tales,” supported by powerful piano stabs on the front of each measure, supporting the chord progression. I’m not going to dive deep into the amazingly catchy vocal melody here, but I encourage you to spend some time with it: put a pencil on paper, and try to follow the vocal’s pitch up or down as you steadily move your hand to the right. Now you have a graph of the chorus melody over time, and it’s easy to see, without caring about specific notes, how its rises and falls create the overall structure of the phrase. From here, the various parts interplay and combine in various ways that support the quick, sharp, spunky nature of the song and production — beautiful.<br /><br />

As you can see, even a relatively simple pop-esque song like “Attracting Flies” is deceptively complex and worth a second (or third) look. You could spend an hour just studying the chorus melody or the sound of that wonky synth. See you next week, hopefully with some new, proper dance music to review.</p>
