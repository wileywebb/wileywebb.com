                <p>Pretty Lights unveils a fantastic new tune that spills over the brim with both classic soul and youthful energy. It’s supported by easily the most beautifully shot concert/live video I’ve ever seen. The video isn’t glaring or in your face like most dance music videos; it’s instead dark, overlaid with flares of colour, and incredibly classy, just like Pretty Lights’ music. Credit to video producer RadioEditAV for supporting the track absolutely perfectly, but now let’s get into the actual music.<br /><br />

(0:00) We begin with a solid groove with much subtle complexity — try to pick out the crunchy attack on the kick drum, the reverse swooshes before some snares, the delicate variations in the hi-hat/shaker sound. In the background, several layers, like sampled record needle noise and hints of orchestral strings and horns, create a thick, juicy atmosphere. The intro subtly builds with the addition of the more elaborate piano riffs and rhythmic layers so that you barely notice the track’s development — so smooth.<br /><br />

(0:45) A thick, dark bass sound dominates the first beat of each measure, posing a “question” to which the vocal sample “responds” in the second, third, and fourth beats of the measure. Listen carefully to that vocal response — some measures have guitar or other instruments carefully integrated into the vocal melody — so cohesive that it’s easy to miss.<br /><br />

(1:20) We hit our first break from what so far has been a constant, driving, trance-inducing groove: light, airy vocal melodies that are chopped, stuttered, and reversed over a simple acoustic guitar ostinato. For the first time in the track, Pretty Lights breaks from subtle, clean sounds to briefly smack listeners in the face with a snare drum roll, heavily layered with dirtied white noise, to build anticipation for the drop.<br /><br />

(1:50) The track drops to the same first beat bass and melodic response in the second half of each measure format. This section’s similarity in rhythm and arrangement to the other sections makes the track incredibly cohesive overall. Here though, the bass has more overtones (the warmth and fuzz that makes it nastier and more noticeable) and pitch bends after each note. A synth plays a simple three-note riff to draw dancers back down into the next 1 beat. Try to pick out all the cool edits and variations in sound and rhythm that start around 2:15. <br /><br />

This track employs many incredibly simple musical riffs and sounds, at least twice as many sounds and riffs as a normal song. But Pretty Lights gets away with such rare musical complexity because he binds every element together so seamlessly, with a powerful “glue” of mixing, arrangement techniques, and sound design. Every time you listen, you’ll discover new elements; I only covered a fraction here. This is truly a masterpiece of cohesion.</p>
